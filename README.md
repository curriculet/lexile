# LexileÂ® 

This gem wraps a portion of the Lexile database API. You need to obtain an
authorized username and password from Lexile to use the API. This gem is not
meant to be a comprenhensive implementation of the API just a bare bones
"Find the Lexile for a Specific Book" solution.

The gem only covers the endpoints to the `book` resource, the `category` and
`serial` resources are beyond the scope of this gem . If you need access
 to these resources feel free to submit a PR with code and specs.

The gem does not support pagination for result-sets longer than 20 books, while
the API contains all provisions for pagination, it is beyond the scope of the
gem to expose those.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'lexile'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lexile
