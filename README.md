# LexileÂ® 

This gem wraps a portion of the Lexile database API. You need to obtain an
authorized username and password from Lexile to use the API. This gem is not
meant to be a comprenhensive implementation of the API just a bare bones
"Find the Lexile for a Specific Book or Update your Lexile DB" solution.

The gem only covers the endpoint to the `book` resource, the `category` and
`serial` resources are beyond the scope of this gem . If you need access
 to these resources feel free to submit a PR with code and specs.

The gem now supports pagination for long result-sets using the `next` and `previous` links
of the `meta` element of the response. Pagination is implemented as an Enumerable and it is
transparent when you traverse the enumerable with each, select, map, etc.... ( `count` will
paginate the whole collection, a more efficient implementation using the `total_count` from 
the `meta` is left as practice for the reader)
